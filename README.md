# OOP - 2023/24 - Assignment 2

This is the base repository for assignment 2.
Please follow the instructions given in the [PDF NEEDED]() for the content of the exercise.

## How to carry out your assignment

1. Use this template and create a private repository:
   ![](use_template.png)
2. Please add your partner and `oop-otoz` to the collaborators.
3. Create a new branch called `submission`.
4. Create your code in the `main` branch.
5. Make sure that Actions are allowed: Settings -> Actions -> General -> Allow all actions and workflows.
6. Create a pull request from the `main` branch to your `submission` branch and check that your changes are captured.
7. When you are ready to submit, add `oop-otoz` to the reviewers.

Put the three classes in three separate files in the `src` folder, with the names specified in the PDF.
**Leave the **init**.py file untouched**.

Put the **main.py** script **outside** of the `src` folder, in the root of this repo.

Below this line, you can write your report to motivate your design choices.

## Submission

The code should be submitted on GitHub by opening a Pull Request from the branch you were working on to the `submission` branch.

There are automated checks that verify that your submission is correct:

1. Deadline - checks that the last commit in a PR was made before the deadline
2. Reproducibility - downloads libraries included in `requirements.txt` and runs `python3 main.py`. If your code does not throw any errors, it will be marked as reproducible. **Make sure it is reproducible before submission!**
3. Style - runs `flake8` on your code to ensure adherence to style guides.
